# Instagram

## Goal
Begin using Ruby on Rails to create a website similar to Instagram

## Description:
I completed my first Ruby on Rails project, by following along with a tutorial, entitled "Make an instagram like site in under 30 minutes! (Ruby on Rails)" which can be found at https://youtu.be/MpFO4Zr0EPE.

## Main Functionality:
### Register

Once a user has created a post, they're shown a page with only that post.

### Index

If the user navigates back to the homepage (by clicking "nupurb's Instagram", they see an index of all posts on the website.
